<!-- The following is an example of the result document of the RSS_Import_Support/itemImport XML resource.  The rssImportResult.dtd (in the AppSupport folder) is used in that resource with the rssImportResult/@channelName attribute mapped to the single HTML parameter "channelName," added to the request by this extension following the import.  The sys_xdCopyDom exit is then used as a "post" exit in order to copy the private request object added by the importer, named in the "statusParam" parameter, to the root of the resource's result document.-->

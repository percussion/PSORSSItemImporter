March 10, 2006 ============================
Added the rss_import_shared.xml shared group file to the zip file in /AppSupport, along
with SQL statements for SQL Server and Oracle to create the table used by this shared 
group and the support app itself.
March 9, 2006 ============================
Nothing!  This is the first build.
